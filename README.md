# Open Save Cloud (Server)

Go to Client repository: [here](https://github.com/mojitaurelie/open-save-cloud-client)

The goal of the project is to have my Sims 4 (and other games) backups accessible from multiple computers.

Currently some old game licenses that have not been updated for a while do not have access to backups in the cloud.
